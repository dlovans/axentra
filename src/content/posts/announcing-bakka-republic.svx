## The Current Crisis

War, oppression, persecution, and corruption rage on in the Middle East. All systems have failedâ€”democracy, communism, capitalism, tribalism, extremism, dictatorship, monarchy. They have been tried, yet they fail to achieve peace without corruption.

## A New Path

**Bakk'a Republic** is a movement born out of frustration with the status quo and seeks to create a nation where the system of God is in place, with only the Qur'an as the source of law.

## Join the Mission

Familiarize yourself with the constitution of the Bakk'a Republic, and answer the call! God-willing, together we can achieve what is written:
